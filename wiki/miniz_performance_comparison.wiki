#summary miniz compared to other compressors

= Introduction =

This page shows how miniz.c compares to several other popular open source data compression codecs. The data here was generated using a slightly modified and enhanced version of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Ratcliff John Ratcliff]'s [http://code.google.com/p/compressiontest/ compressiontest] project, compiled to x64.

For comparison purposes, I've added [http://nothings.org/stb_image.c stb_image.c]'s Inflater implementation to compresssiontest, and [http://code.google.com/p/lzham/ LZHAM] alpha7. Note that miniz.c is used for compressing the data supplied to stb_image.c for decompression (stb_image.c does not include compression support).

These tests where performed under Win7 x64, Intel Gulftown Core i7 (6 cores, 12 hyperthreads), 24GB of RAM, EVGA X58 motherboard. All code was compiled with Visual Studio 2005.
